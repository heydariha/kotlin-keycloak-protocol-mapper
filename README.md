##  Keycloak Custom Protocol Mapper with Kotlin and Gradle
This repository contains an example Keycloak Protocol Mapper to customize the JWT returned by Keycloak
using Kotlin and Gradle.

There were only examples using Maven and Java around so I found it would be good to build a minimal example using Kotlin.
